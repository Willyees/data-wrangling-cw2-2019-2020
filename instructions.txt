python script is ready to go, but need some arguments in the code.
pre-processing dataset is done in the function clean_dict. It is already called in the main()

What is needed to be done:
set the "file_path" in the main to the path of the dataset file in your hard drive

What can you do:
1)run random initialized word embedding model by setting word2vec param false
2)run word2vec embedded model using the dataset by setting word2vec param true and pre_embedding false
3)run pre-embedded model by setting word2vec true and pre_embedding true and global variable path_model_wc to the path of the downloaded preembedded (you have to have it on your hard drive)
4)downsampling by using the run_single_model(downsample=true)

All the parameter settings have to be done on the source code.
